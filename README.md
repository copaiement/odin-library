# Odin Library/Reading List

## About
This webpage holds a list of books with title, author, and number of pages information. The user can
input information about each book and can update their status (read/unread)

## Thoughts
Pretty fun project that used slightly more advanced DOM manipulation to build the "library cards".
There are still some minor tweaks that could be done like stopping the user from inputting duplicate
books, and adding a dark mode slider (I like these). Also, there is currently no mobile support
so that could potentially be added in the future.
